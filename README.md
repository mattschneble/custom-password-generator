## Description 

This project was assigned to me to create a professional web portfolio that potential employers can view. The goal of this project was to have a page used as examples. I continued to grow my HTML and CSS skills. This has an about me section, screenshots and links to previously completed projects, and various ways to reach me.

## Usage 

This page is to be used to understand who I am, what some of my previous projects are, and how to contact me.

## Learning Points 

Throughout the development of this webpage, I was able to learn about HTML and CSS elements and how they interact with diferent web browsers.
I used my knowledge gained to help reorganize code to make things easier to understand, when attributes had the same properties.

## Credits

I would like to shoutout some of my classmate; Sonam Sherpa, Jay Liu and Thomas Munzar for assisting me with debugging and helping me to understand where some of my mistakes were made. All code was entered by myself. I also utilized the MDN sites above to help understand concepts and how to use proper syntax, but all code was entered by myself.
